    BaseFlow is a class for managing and executing a sequence of flows, where each flow can be an 
    instance of BaseAgent or another BaseFlow. This class facilitates creating complex interaction 
    workflows by sequencing and nesting agents and flows.

    Parameters
    ----------
    flows : Union[BaseAgent, BaseFlow, List[Union[BaseAgent, BaseFlow]]], optional
        A single or a list of BaseAgent or BaseFlow instances that constitute the flow. Default is an empty list.
    verbose_level : int, optional
        The verbosity level for output logging during flow execution. Default is 1.
    flow_name : str, optional
        The name of the flow, used primarily for identification and logging. Default is an empty string.
    hooks : BaseFlow.FlowHooks, optional
        Custom hooks for different stages of the flow execution. Default is an empty dictionary.

    Attributes
    ----------
    flows : List[Union[BaseAgent, BaseFlow]]
        The list of flows (BaseAgent or BaseFlow instances) to be executed.
    flow_name : str
        The name assigned to this flow.
    verbose_level : int
        The verbosity level for output logging.
    hooks : Dict[str, List[Callable[..., Any]]]
        The dictionary of hooks for different stages of flow execution.

    Methods
    -------
    run_flow(message='')
        Executes the flow with an optional initial message.
    _run_flow(message='')
        A placeholder method for the actual flow execution logic.
    _execute_hooks(hook_name, *args, **kwargs)
        Executes a set of hooks based on the provided hook name.
    _execute_alter_hooks(hook_name, message)
        Modifies the given message using specified 'alter' hooks.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> agent = BaseAgent(name="ExampleAgent")
    >>> flow = BaseFlow(flows=[agent], flow_name="ExampleFlow")

        """
        A placeholder method designed to be overridden by subclasses to implement the specific logic of 
        running the flow with the given message.

        This method is intended to encapsulate the core logic of how the flow processes a message. In its 
        base form, it returns a simple string indicating that the flow has been called with the provided 
        message. Subclasses should override this method to provide the actual implementation of the flow's 
        behavior with the LLM or other components.

        Parameters
        ----------
        message : str, optional
            The message or input message to the flow. Default is an empty string.

        Returns
        -------
        str
            The result of processing the message within the flow. In this placeholder implementation, it 
            simply returns a formatted string indicating the flow name and the message.

        Notes
        -----
        - Subclasses should override this method to implement the specific interaction logic with the LLM 
        or other processes constituting the flow.
        - This method is typically called by `run_flow`, which manages pre- and post-processing hooks.

        Examples
        --------

    def _execute_hooks(self, hook_name, *args, **kwargs):
        """
        Executes a set of hooks identified by the provided hook name.

        This method iterates through all the hooks registered under the specified `hook_name` and 
        executes each one, passing along any additional arguments and keyword arguments provided.

        Parameters
        ----------
        hook_name : str
            The name of the hook stage to be executed. This corresponds to a key in the `hooks` attribute.
        *args
            Variable length argument list. These are the arguments that will be passed to each hook function.
        **kwargs
            Arbitrary keyword arguments. These will be passed to each hook function.

        Notes
        -----
        - The method supports verbose output. At verbosity level 3, it prints detailed information about the 
        hook execution, including the arguments and keyword arguments. At level 2, it announces the hook stage execution.
        - Hooks are functions defined to be executed at specific stages of the flow. They allow for customization 
        of behavior at these stages.

        Examples
        --------

        Executes 'alter' hooks associated with the given hook_name to potentially modify the message.

        This method iterates through all the hooks registered under the specified hook_name. Each hook is a function 
        that takes the current message as an argument and returns a modified version of it. The method applies these 
        modifications sequentially, allowing for cumulative changes to the message.

        Parameters
        ----------
        hook_name : str
            The name of the 'alter' hook stage to execute. This identifies the specific group of hooks to be applied.
