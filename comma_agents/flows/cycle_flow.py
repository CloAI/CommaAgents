class CycleFlow(BaseFlow):
    """
    CycleFlow is a subclass of BaseFlow designed to execute a series of flows or agents multiple times in a cycle.

    This class extends BaseFlow by adding the capability to run the specified flows repeatedly for a 
    defined number of cycles. It allows for additional customization through 'cycle' specific hooks.

    Parameters
    ----------
    flows : Union[List[Union[BaseAgent, BaseFlow]], BaseFlow], optional
        A single flow, agent, or a list of flows and agents that constitute the cycle. Default is an empty list.
    cycles : int, optional
        The number of times the sequence of flows should be executed. Default is 1.
    hooks : CycleFlow.CycleFlowHooks, optional
        Custom hooks for different stages of the cycle execution. Default is an empty dictionary.
    **kwargs
        Arbitrary keyword arguments that are passed to the BaseFlow's constructor for further customization.

    Attributes
    ----------
    cycles : int
        The number of cycles the flow should run.
    hooks : Dict[str, List[Callable[..., Any]]]
        The dictionary of hooks for different stages of cycle execution.

    Methods
    -------
    _run_flow(message='')
        Executes the flows in a cycle for the specified number of times.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> agent1 = BaseAgent(name="Agent1")
    >>> agent2 = BaseAgent(name="Agent2")
    >>> cycle_flow = CycleFlow(flows=[agent1, agent2], cycles=2)
    >>> response = cycle_flow.run_flow(message="Start")
    """

    class CycleFlowHooks(BaseFlow.FlowHooks):
        """
        A subclass of BaseFlow.FlowHooks defining additional hooks specific to the CycleFlow.

        Attributes
        ----------
        alter_message_before_cycle : Optional[Callable[..., Any]]
            Hook to modify the message before each cycle begins.
        alter_message_after_cycle : Optional[Callable[..., Any]]
            Hook to modify the message after each cycle ends.

        Parameters
        ----------
        flows : Union[List[Union[BaseAgent, BaseFlow]], BaseFlow], optional
            The flows to include in this cycle. Default is an empty list.

            The number of cycles the flow should run. Default is 1.
