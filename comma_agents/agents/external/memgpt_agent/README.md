# MemGPT!

I want to acknowledge the major work done by the authors of the MemGPT paper. They proved a concept and developed a wonderful project that provides an excellent example and use case of MemGPT. I did try to see if I could import their project into this project, and make memgpt a dependency, however, it does seem that they utilized more of a OpenAI Chat API workflow(needing to hit an endpoint) than local llms(they use proxies it seems). This is not a critique, but rather a reasoning as to why I created my own MemGPT like agent from scratch. However, I do not want to seem like I am trying to take away from their implantation and work. Please support them with their project! Here are the sources of their work :D
