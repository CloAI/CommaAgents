# CycleObserverFlow: Watch Your Cycles

## Overview 🌟
`CycleObserverFlow` 🔄, a creative twist in the `comma_agents` package, evolves from `CycleFlow` to offer a unique feature: the integration of an 'observer' agent. This agent acts as a smart analyst 🕵️‍♂️ or transformer within the cyclical execution, enriching each round of processing with insights or modifications.

## Key Features 🔑
- **Observer Agent Inclusion** 👀: Adds an extra layer of processing by integrating a `BaseAgent` as an observer. This agent steps in after each cycle to analyze or tweak outputs.
- **Enhanced Cyclical Execution** 🚀: Combines the repetitive pattern of `CycleFlow` with the added depth of an observer agent, leading to more sophisticated output after each cycle.

## Initialization Parameters 🏗️
- `observer_agent`: (Optional) A `BaseAgent` to act as the observer, adding versatility to the cycle. Defaults to `None`.
- `**kwargs`: Inherits the adaptable keyword arguments from `CycleFlow`, allowing for broad customization.

## Attributes 📊
- `observer_agent`: The `BaseAgent` taking on the observer's role, adding an extra dimension to the cycle flow.

## Methods 🛠️
### `alter_message_after_cycle`
- Activated post-cycle, this method lets the observer `BaseAgent` process and potentially reshape the intermediate message, adding a twist to the tale.

## Exceptions 🚨
- Signals a `ValueError` if `observer_agent` isn't a valid `BaseAgent`.

## Code Example 🎨
```python
from comma_agents.flows import CycleObserverFlow
from comma_agents.agents import BaseAgent

# Crafting an analyzing agent
class AnalyzingAgent(BaseAgent):
    def call(self, message):
        # Analyzes or modifies the message
        return "[Analyzed] " + message

# Initializing the observer agent
analyzer = AnalyzingAgent(name="DataAnalyzer")

# Setting up CycleObserverFlow with an analytical twist
cycle_observer_flow = CycleObserverFlow(observer_agent=analyzer, cycles=3)

# Kickstarting the flow
response = cycle_observer_flow.run_flow(message="Observing cycles...")
```
In this setup, `AnalyzingAgent` enriches the message with "[Analyzed]" after each cycle, leading to an evolving narrative through the cycles.
